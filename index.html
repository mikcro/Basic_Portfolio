         <p class="index_first_par">For 25 years I have been emersed in the fire protection and security fields. I can walk up to a building and tell about the systems that make it function. Some people see buildings as a beautiful skyscraper covered in a skin of glass. I see a complicated,
         functioning, integrated organism. My carreer came to an abrupt end February of 2016 when I fell 27 feet and nearly died, breaking by back in 4 places, crushing my spinal cord and many other bones. I woke up totally paralyzed from the chest down but I was ready for the next challenge...learning to walk again.
         </p>

        <p class="index_second_par"> Grit! Since that day I have fought for recovery. I was tenacious in rehab and God blessed. What the doctors said I couldnt do, with Gods help I have. I am gaining back my independence. My vision with its many challenges and physical limitations,
         has now focused on coding as a new career choice. Like those who viewed that skyscraper, I viewed the internet...from the outside as a user only. Now with a keen desire to understand the inner workings of this complicated, functioning, integrated
          organism we call the world wide web, I have decided to take the next step and plunge into the world of coding. Catch me if you can!
