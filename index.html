      <p>Hi. For 25 years I have been emersed in the fire protection and security fields. I can walk up to a building and tell about the systems that make it function. Some people see buildings as a beautiful skyscraper covered in a skin of glass. I see
        a functioning organism. My carreer came to an abrupt end February of 2016 when I fell 27 feet breaking by back in 4 places, crushing my spinal cord and many other bones. I woke up paralyzed. I was ready for the next challenge...working to walk.
        </p>
      <p> Since my accident with its many challenges I have been guided to coding. Like some people view that skyscraper, I viewed code. I saw the internet. Now I have a keen desire to understand the inner going ons of this organism. I am ready to jump in! </p>
